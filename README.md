Overview
This repository contains the SAS code and related documentation for a comprehensive sales analysis of Adventure Works. The project encompasses data importation, cleaning, merging, and analysis phases to extract meaningful insights from the company's product and sales order details. The goal was to address specific analytical questions and generate a report summarizing the findings.

Project Structure
The project is organized into five main phases:

Data Import: Utilized Proc Import to load data from Excel sheets into SAS datasets for Products and SalesOrderDetails.
Data Cleaning: Created cleaned versions of the datasets (Product_Clean and SalesOrderDetail_Clean) by selecting specific columns, formatting, and handling missing values.
Joining and Merging: Merged the cleaned datasets to form a SalesDetails dataset for analysis, focusing on specific product details and sales information.
Data Analysis: Performed detailed analyses to answer predefined questions regarding sales in 2013 and 2014, including color-specific product sales, total sales, and more. Utilized Proc Print for reporting and generated a chart for a chosen analysis.
Project Report: Compiled a detailed report in MS Word, documenting each phase, including screenshots of outputs, SAS code, and the chart from the analysis phase.
Analytical Questions Addressed
Quantity of red helmets sold in 2013 and 2014.
Sales of multi-colored items in 2013 and 2014.
Combined sales total of all helmets for the mentioned years.
Sales figures for the Yellow Color Touring-1000 in 2013 and 2014.
Total sales for 2013 and 2014.
Chart Analysis
A chart was created as part of the data analysis phase to visualize one of the aspects of the SalesAnalysis dataset. The chosen analysis and the rationale behind the selection of this particular visualization are detailed in the project report.

Project Report
The final report includes a comprehensive walkthrough of each project phase, the SAS code used, outputs, and the analysis chart. The report aims to provide a clear understanding of the methodologies applied and the insights derived from the sales data.
